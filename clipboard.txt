Cotiviti is a leading provider of payment accuracy and analytics-driven solutions that helps payers, other risk-bearing healthcare organizations and retailers to gain insights into the complex interactions between clients and their stakeholders thus optimize financial performance, reduce inefficiency, and improve overall healthcare value. 
Cotiviti has engaged Randstad for re-platforming their Rules Maintenance Interface (RMI) application to include current PR, RMR, PRR processes and associated workflows on to a newer platform. This overall effort will be referred to as the RMI Re-Platforming project.
RMI has been around for more than two decades. It’s a key component of Prospective Claims Accuracy (PCA) toolsets and related workflows. It is an Oracle Forms based application tightly coupled to a backend Oracle database. Because of its legacy technology platform, RMI application has not had a lot of changes done to it and has not kept up with rest of Cotiviti’s technology landscape that are relatively modern in nature. 
The key driver for this re-platforming initiative is to allow Cotiviti to retire the legacy Oracle forms and Lotus Notes components of the RMI solution while minimizing the impact to the backend Oracle database.
