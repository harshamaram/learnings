Welcome to Comcast Digital Home's Pre‐Interview Questionnaire! 

Interviewing candidates takes a lot of time, and time is valuable for all of us.

If you are as serious about working for Comcast as we are about working with great people, please take the time to fill out this questionnaire. We devised these questions as a test of skills we consider primary and fundamental.The in‐person interview questions will be more difficult, and hopefully a better test of your programming skills. 

Instructions: 
Work on this alone. Feel free to use google or any reference material you have. If you can't solve a problem, comment on it. 

Ranking 
Rate yourself on the following technologies on a scale of 1‐10. You may be asked to justify these answers in an interview. 
1 ‐ Beginner (I don't really know that)
4 ‐ Intermediate (I can work without help)
6 ‐ Advanced (People come to me for help in esoteric or hard problems) 8 ‐ Industry Expert (People outside my office see me as an expert)
10 ‐ Spec/Language Author or Primary Contributor.

Code Questions 
1. What will be the output? 
Integer a = new Integer(1);
Set numbers = new HashSet<>();
numbers.add(4);
numbers.add(3);
numbers.add(4);
numbers.add(5);
numbers.add(new Integer(6));
numbers.add(a);
List sortedList = new ArrayList(numbers); 
Collections.sort(sortedList, Collections.reverseOrder()); 
System.out.println(sortedList); 


Answer: [6, 5, 4, 3, 1]
2. There are at least 2 bugs in this code. What are they and how would you fix them? 

List employees = new ArrayList<>(); 
employees.add(new Employee("Paul")); 
employees.add(new Employee("John")); 
employees.add(new Employee("George")); 
employees.add(new Employee("Ringo")); 
for (Employee e : new ArrayList(employees)) { 
	//easy fix - else - using iterator or java 8 streams is also possible 
	if (e.getName().equals("John")) {
		//String comparison using reference equality – should check for value equality 
		employees.remove(e);//modifying same list while reading it - java.util.ConcurrentModificationException 
	} 
} 
System.out.println(employees); 

Answer: 
#1) In "for" loop, we have to typecast ArrayList with "Employee". 
#2) Can not use remove method on List. I prefer to use listIterator as below. 
Other option is to copy into another array based on given condition, which uses high memory and unnecessary. 

Employee e;
ListIterator<Employee> listIt = employees.listIterator();
while(listIt.hasNext()) {
	e = listIt.next();			
	if ("John".equalsIgnoreCase(e.getName())) {
		// its good to compare against a constant rather than constant against variable. 
		listIt.remove();
		// listIt.add(new Employee("James")) also allowed here 
		// ListIterator allows to delete or add objects while iterating through it
	}
}
System.out.println(employees); 
	
3. What will be the output? 
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); List letters = Arrays.asList("A","B","C"); 
for (String letter : letters) {
for (int i = 0; i <= letters.indexOf(letter); i++) { 
      sb.append(letter);
    }
sb.append(System.lineSeparator()); } 
System.out.println(sb.toString());

Answer:
findEntityByIdAndType must be having business logic implementation and might be operating on 'null'. May be the database returns (guessing based on the method naming standards) some columns as nulls and
